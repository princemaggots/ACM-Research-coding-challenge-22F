# Info
In this project, I set out to find which year of make, exterior color, and interior color was most common among the "Brand Certified" cars for each brand, as well as the average price for those cars. I then compared the results to these properties for non-certified cars. I go in detail on this process [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/princemaggots/acm-coding-challenge).

I haven't used Python since high school, and when I did, it wasn't for anything related to data analysis, so I was a little intimidated when I first saw this project. However, I wanted to challenge myself so I pushed through and found that it was a lot more simple than I thought it would be. It took me a few hours, however this was partially due to my inexperience in Python (and the Kaggle software) and partially also due to me deciding to manually filter the colors down to a more reasonable number (since a lot of the colors were just different shades of the same color). In the end, I feel like this project taught me a lot about working with datasets, as well as Python, and I'm glad I did it.
